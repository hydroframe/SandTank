      The ParFlow Sandtank model is a free tool that allows users to
      interactively simulate and visualize groundwater movement through a
      virtual slice of the subsurface. The  app is designed to teach hydrogeology
      concepts. Users can adjust groundwater levels, change subsurface
      properties, pump groundwater, add pollutants and watch the system respond
      in real time.
    </p>
    <p class="body-1 pt-4">
      The ParFlow Sandtank can be used as a stand-alone tool or as a supplement
      to existing lessons that use physical sand tank models. Refer to the
      <a href="https://www.hydroframe.org/sand-tank-user-manual">User Manual</a>
      and <a href="https://www.hydroframe.org/lesson-plans">Lesson Plan Video</a>

      is an open-source web application designed by the
      <a href="https://www.hydroframe.org/"">HydroFrame Team</a> and developed by
      <a href="https://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a>
      to support increased accessibility and usability of hydrology tools for
      research and teaching. It uses
      <a href="https://parflow.org/">ParFlow</a> for its simulation backend and
      <a href="https://www.paraview.org">ParaView</a> for the data loading and
      processing. The communication infrastructure relies on the
      <a href="http://www.paraview.org/web/">ParaViewWeb</a> framework.
